        <Text style={styles.text}>Drawn from scenes of Falon Darville's childhood in France, The Unwelcome Portal novels tease out what it means to adopt an adult thought-paradigm. The first book and its sequel, The Waker, trace the child protagonist Ada as she comes easily to terms with the alternate world festering in plain sight. Itâ€™s a coming-of-age novel in the most terrifying sense, filled with hollowed eyes, glowing figures, and nonsensical adults.</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
        	The novels move you through worlds of dreams, tactical transformation, and natural environments. Ada meets an old man who keeps staring at a wall, a boy who can move sand, and a glowing girl. They all have something in common with eachother...and with Ada.
